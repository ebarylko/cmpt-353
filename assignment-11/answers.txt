1. The intermediate results I cached were the full set of posts I read at the beginning and the posts
belonging to the subreddits with a positive average score. If I had not cached these DataFrames, I would
be evaluating the same execution plan for a DataFrame multiple times.

2. When using broadcasting, the reddit_relative.py file took 93.447 seconds. In comparison, the same file took
111.014 seconds when not using broadcasting.
