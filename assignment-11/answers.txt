no broadcasting:  1m51.014s
Broadcasting:     1m33.447s

1. The intermediate results I cached were the full set of posts I read at the beginning and the posts
belonging to the subreddits with a positive average score. If I had not cached these DataFrames, I would
be evaluating the same execution plan for a DataFrame multiple times.

2. By hinting that a DataFrame could be broadcast, the reddit_relative.py file ran approximately 18 seconds
faster compared to when no broadcasting occurred.
