First dataset:
This dataset holds a collection of x and y values contains a strong positive correlation between them.

Second dataset:

This dataset has a strong positive correlation between the x and y values and has most of the data concentrated
at (-9, 9) on the x-axis.

Third dataset:

This dataset contains clusters of data spaced out by two units on the x-axis, with each cluster's
y values being 0.5 +- the mean value of the cluster.

Fourth dataset:

This dataset has an extremely weak linear relationship and has some of the data points spelling out SFU.

Fifth dataset:

This dataset has an extremely weak negative correlation and the data can be separated into five distinct
groups: those having an x-value in the range of 4 to 10 (inclusive); data having an x-value between 27 and 30,
data having an x-value between 46 and 50, data having an x-value between 66 and 70, and data having an x-value between
90 and 94.

Sixth dataset:

This data shows an extremely positive linear relationship, with only two points that can not be mapped to the best
fit line.
