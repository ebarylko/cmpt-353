1. The best function which changes the dataset in such a way that the new dataset
satisfies the assumptions of a T-test is np.sqrt

2. For the original dataset, rejecting the null hypothesis would mean that within the r/canada subreddit
in 2012-2013, the average number of comments made on weekdays differ from the average number of comments made on weekends.
For the transformed dataset, rejecting the null hypothesis has the same meaning as rejecting the null
hypothesis with the original dataset. Since the square root function is monotonic, any conclusion about the
transformed dataset would also hold for the original dataset. Therefore, concluding that the averages of the
square roots of the weekday and weekend comment counts differ implies that the averages of the weekday and
weekend comment counts also differ.

3. I believe the best approach which answers the original question is transforming the data
using np.sqrt. Compared with the other methods which answer an alternate question or
give a dubious T-test p-value, transforming the data using np.sqrt gives the best of both
worlds; the initial question answered by the data remains unchanged and the p-value of the
T-test can be used with confidence.

4. On average, the r/canada subreddit in the years 2012-2013 has more comments posted on weekdays than on weekends.
