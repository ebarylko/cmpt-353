1. The times taken for the reddit_averages.py file to run using certain directories and restrictions are
the following: it took 52.42 seconds when using the reddit-0 directory; it took 103.91 seconds when using the reddit-2b
directory with a schema; it took 137.65 seconds when using the reddit-2b directory without a schema; it took
116.31 seconds when using the reddit-2b directory with a schema and caching.

2. Most of the time taken to process the reddit-2 data is in reading it. since we see a difference of
approximately 33 seconds when not using a schema. This means that it takes 33 seconds to read all the data into a
Pyspark DataFrame. Considering that it takes approximately 52 seconds to read and process the data and 33 seconds
of that time is devoted to reading the data, only 19 seconds is used towards calculating the averages.


reddit-0: 52.420s

3. Within the wikipedia_popular.py file, I placed the call to the cache method after filtering the
wikipedia pages written in english and those whose title does not start with "Special:" or is "Main_Page".
