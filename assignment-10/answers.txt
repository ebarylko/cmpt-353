1. The times taken for the reddit_averages.py file to run using the following directories and restrictions are
the following: it took 52.42 seconds when using the reddit-0 directory; it took 103.91 seconds when using the reddit-2b
directory with a schema; it took 137.65 seconds when using the reddit-2b directory without a schema; it took
116.31 seconds when using the reddit-2b directory with a schema and caching.

2. I would say that most of the time taken to process the reddit-2 data is in reading it, since we see a difference of
approximately 33 seconds when not using a schema.

reddit-0: 52.420s
reddit-2b with schema:  1m43.912s
reddit-2b without schema:  2m17.654s
reddit-2b with schema and cache: 1m56.312s
