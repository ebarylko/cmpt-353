1. The expression  data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept
represents the best fit line for our data. The type of the best fit line is a
Pandas Series of type float64.
2. Every value in created_at can be mapped to one value in timestamp by
representing a date by the number of seconds since the epoch. Therefore,
every point on the best fit line, which uses the values in timestamp,
can be mapped to a specific date in created_at. As a result, we have a fit
line that approximates our data by pairing together the date and the
estimated rating for that date.
