1. The result of `data['timestamp']*fit.slope + fit.intercept`
represents the best fit line for our data. The type of the best fit line is a
Pandas Series of type float64.
2.
In the same hint, why does this produce a fit line on the graph?
 Why are the created_at values and timestamp values paired correctly
 to make points on the plot?
 We have an
 Even though we change the dates from a datetime to the time in seconds,
 we still have the correspondence between the datetime and the rating it is
 associated to.

For each pair of the date and the rating on that date, it can be mapped to
a pair of the seconds since the epoch and the rating for that date.
Since we have a one to one correspondence, creating the best fit line
using the timestamp for each date and the ratings will produce one that
approximates our data well
