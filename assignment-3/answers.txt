1. I believe that the results obtained with the Kalman filter are more accurate compared to the
values obtained after using LOESS smoothing. I noticed that the data obtained using LOESS smoothing
implied that the temperatures in the majority of the hours had little fluctuation, while the data after
applying the Kalman filter suggested that temperatures are steady in most hours over a larger range of
temperatures.

2. A higher acceleration in the x, y, and z dimensions suggests that the target will move farther
compared to previous observations, implying that a larger impact to the longitude and latitude will be seen
in the next observation. Similarly, a lower acceleration indicates that the target will move less in the following
observations, hinting that the target's longitude and latitude will not change much.
