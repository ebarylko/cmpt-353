1. I do not believe that daily temperatures are a good measure for the population density of a city.
Viewing the graph comparing the average daily temperature against the population density of a city,
there is no apparent linear relationship between the two. Therefore, inferring the population
density of a city from the average temperature may not give the most accurate result.

2. Compressing the data allows the storage of larger datasets in a more compact form,
using less storage on a computer compared to its uncompressed form. By decompressing the
data only when we need it, we are able to work with multiple compressed large datasets
using only a fraction of the storage required than if the data had been uncompressed.
