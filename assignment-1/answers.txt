1. I found that there was not a significant difference in effort when
reproducing the calculations with Numpy or Pandas. I was able to
apply the same approach I took when manipulating the data with Numpy to
when I was using Pandas, making it clear which functions I should be
searching for in the Pandas library. In my opinion, the calculations
performed using Pandas are easier to read.

2. The running times of the `pivot_months_pandas` and `pivot_months_loops`
functions were 4.79 ms and 90.6 ms, respectively. This difference is due to the
way Pandas stores and manipulates data. Through optimizing data structures
and operations using implementations of both in C, calculations done using
Pandas are quicker than if one had solely used Python.
Therefore, we would expect the runtime of pivot_months_pandas
to be lower than pivot_months_loops due to more Pandas data structures
and operations being used in the former file; Comparing the runtimes,
we see that pivot_months_pandas is 18.9 times faster than
pivot_months_loops, matching the expectation about the runtimes.
