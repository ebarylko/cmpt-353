1. For me, the steps we take to analyze the data do not involve p-hacking since we have only redefined our
original hypothesis to look at the proportion of the population most impacted by the search feature.
Since we have not done anything strange, using an alpha value of 0.05 for this test seems reasonable.

2. If we had run a T-test between every pair of wall time averages for the sorting algorithms, we would
have 7c2 = 21 T-tests. Since each T-test has an alpha value of 0.05, we have a probability of
0.95^21 = 0.3406 of all the tests not reporting a false positive. The probability of at least one
test reporting a false positive would be 1 - 0.3406 = 0.6594.

3. The sorting algorithms, ranked from slowest to fastest, are qs4 > merge1 > qs5 > qs1 > partition_sort,
where a > b indicates that algorithm a takes on average longer than algorithm b.
Algorithms qs2 and qs3 could not be ordered and are therefore not included in the order
above.
