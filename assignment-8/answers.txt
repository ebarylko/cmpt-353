1. The k-nearest neighbours model trained on LAB color values had the highest validation scores compared to
the other five models. In general, all models trained on LAB color values performed better than their
RGB color value counterparts; I believe this is due to LAB color space being more perceptually uniform,
making distance measurements between two data points more meaningful. As to why the k-nearest
neighbours model trained on LAB colors had the best performance of all the models, this is due to it
using the distance between data points to assign a label. As a result of using meaningful
distance measurements, it was able to assign labels that tended to be more accurate than the labels
assigned by other models.

2. For some cities, the error is reasonable since the observations in the mistaken and expected cities are clustered
similarly. I believe additional features in the dataset which could aid in uniquely identifying cities are cloud
cover, air quality, and UV index.
