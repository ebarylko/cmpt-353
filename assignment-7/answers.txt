1. Looking at the histogram of the residuals, the graph appears to not deviate largely from
a normal distribution. Considering this and the fact there are more than forty data points,
 I believe looking at the OLS p-value has merit. Regarding whether the ratings are increasing, seeing that
 the p-value from the OLS is lower than 0.05 and the best fit line demonstrates a positive correlation between time
 and ratings, I can conclude that the ratings are increasing.

2. I believe the coefficients used in the first row of the transition matrix of the Kalman filter
aid in capturing the true signal. The Kalman filter configured with these coefficients
appears to be avoiding extreme outliers created by the noise, obtaining data which is closer to
the true signal.
