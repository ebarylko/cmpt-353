1. Looking at the histogram of the residuals, the graph appears to not deviate largely from the
appearance of a normal distribution and there are more than forty data points. Taking these
two points into considerations, I believe looking at the OLS p-value has merit. Regarding
whether the ratings are increasing, the p-value from the OLS does not answer this regardless
if the null hypothesis can be rejected or not. Therefore, I can not conclude that the
ratings are increasing.

2. I do not believe the coefficients used in the first row of the transition matrix of the Kalman filter
greatly aid in capturing the true signal. The Kalman filter configured with these coefficients
appears to be capturing a large portion of noise in the data, not helping with getting closer to the
real signal.
